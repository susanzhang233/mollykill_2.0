### Abstract

This project aims to build a model that would aid novel drug design processes. Somewhat related to [this](https://github.com/susanzhang233/mollykill) mollykill, this project hopes to simplify limitations of the generator and decoder by disregarding the GAN structure. Here, we'll be more focused on employing the accuracy and efficiency of the discriminator. Then, instead of letting the generator to come up with new molecules starting from zero. We'll be applying a larger real world molecule datasets(ie. Zinc15), to mimic the traditional virtual/actual screening process to come up with potential inhibitors.


### Planned Deliverables
Dry-lab subpart: a model that could be applied to proteins in general terms would be created.
Wet-lab subpart: in vitro demonstration backing the validation of the model.


### Resources Required
-training set: 3cl protease?
-testing set: 

-possible target molecule synthesized
-3clp expressed: an in vitro assay system to be created


### Tools/Skills Required
-model
